# Agent Awareness Plan: Enabling Intelligent Symptom Tracking

This document outlines the plan for implementing agent awareness across the three components of our medical application ecosystem:

1. **TxAgent Container** - The AI agent running in RunPod
2. **Backend Server** - Express.js API server
3. **Frontend Expo App** - Mobile client application

## Overview

The goal is to enable a natural, conversational flow where the AI can:
- Recognize user intent to log symptoms
- Extract symptom details from conversation
- Save symptoms to the database
- Retrieve symptom history
- Present symptom trends and patterns
- Make recommendations based on symptom history

## Current Architecture

Currently, the system operates with:
- **TxAgent Container**: Processes queries and returns responses with enhanced user context support
- **Full-Stack Doctor's Portal Backend**: Routes requests, manages authentication, and handles database operations
- **Expo User's App Frontend**: Presents UI and sends user queries with medical profile context
- **Doctor's Portal Document Uploader**: Document upload, search and TxAgent RAG chat interface with no user context (for RAG testing the agent). This chat endpoint should remain functional and "as is" - it is not a medical consultation chat and has no user data or context in the request.

The missing piece is the ability for the AI to recognize when a user in the expo app (frontend) wants to log a symptom and then take appropriate action.

**TxAgent**: "‚úÖ I've logged your headache in your symptom history.

Based on your medical profile and documents, headaches can be caused by various factors including stress, dehydration, or underlying conditions. Given your history of migraines and current medications, this could be related to your existing condition. Would you like me to provide some management strategies from your medical documents?"

**User**: "Show me my headache history"

**TxAgent**: "üìä I found 5 headache entries in your history. Your most recent entry was 'headache' logged recently.

Based on your pattern, you seem to experience headaches every few days. Here's some relevant information from your medical documents about headache management..."

### Phase 2.1: Advanced NLP Processing - ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

#### A. Enhanced Symptom Extraction (`nlp_processor.py`)

**Advanced Pattern Recognition:**
```python
# Context-aware symptom detection
symptom_contexts = {
    "pain": {
        "types": ["sharp", "dull", "throbbing", "burning", "stabbing"],
        "locations": ["head", "back", "chest", "stomach", "neck"]
    },
    "digestive": {
        "symptoms": ["nausea", "vomiting", "diarrhea", "constipation"],
        "triggers": ["eating", "food", "meal", "spicy", "dairy"]
    }
}
```

**Temporal Understanding:**
- Duration extraction: "for 3 hours", "since yesterday", "all day"
- Frequency patterns: "every day", "3 times per week", "occasionally"
- Onset timing: "started this morning", "began after eating"

**Severity Context:**
- Numeric scales: "7 out of 10", "8/10", "scale of 9"
- Qualitative descriptors: "unbearable", "mild", "moderate", "severe"
- Comparative indicators: "worse than yesterday", "better than last time"

**Quality Descriptors:**
- Pain qualities: "sharp", "dull", "throbbing", "burning", "stabbing"
- Texture qualities: "rough", "smooth", "bumpy", "raised"
- Movement qualities: "pulsing", "twitching", "spasming"

#### B. Intelligent Follow-up Questions

**Context-Aware Question Generation:**
```python
follow_up_questions = {
    "missing_severity": [
        "How would you rate the severity on a scale of 1-10?",
        "Is this mild, moderate, or severe?",
        "How intense is the {symptom}?"
    ],
    "missing_duration": [
        "How long have you been experiencing this?",
        "When did the {symptom} start?"
    ],
    "missing_location": [
        "Where exactly do you feel the {symptom}?",
        "Which part of your {body_area} is affected?"
    ]
}
```

        "severe": "Severe headaches (8+/10) may require medical attention, especially if they're sudden or different from usual.",
        "chronic": "Frequent headaches may benefit from identifying triggers and consulting with a healthcare provider."
    }
}
```

#### C. Emergency Detection

### Phase 2.4: Expected User Experience - üéØ TARGET

#### Scenario 1: Complex Symptom Logging

**User**: "I've been having this terrible migraine for the past 6 hours. The pain is excruciating, probably a 9 out of 10, and it's concentrated on the left side of my head. It started after I skipped lunch and didn't drink enough water."

**TxAgent Phase 2**: "‚úÖ I've logged your migraine with the following details:
- **Severity**: 9/10 (excruciating)
- **Duration**: 6 hours
- **Location**: Left side of head
- **Triggers**: Skipped meal, dehydration

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This is a severe migraine (9/10). Given your history of migraines and the high severity, you may want to take your prescribed medication if available.

üí° **Medical Advice**: For severe migraines, rest in a dark, quiet room, stay hydrated, and consider your usual migraine medication. If this is different from your usual pattern or doesn't improve, consult your healthcare provider.

Based on your medical documents, I can provide specific migraine management strategies. Would you like me to share those recommendations?"

#### Scenario 2: Incomplete Information with Follow-up

**User**: "My back has been hurting"

**TxAgent Phase 2**: "‚úÖ I've noted your back pain. To better track this symptom, could you help me with a few details?

‚ùì **How would you rate the pain severity on a scale of 1-10?**

I'd also like to know:
- How long have you been experiencing this?
- Where exactly in your back do you feel the pain?

This information will help me provide better recommendations and track patterns in your symptoms."

#### Scenario 3: Emergency Detection

**User**: "I'm having severe chest pain and I can't breathe properly"

**TxAgent Phase 2**: "üö® **URGENT**: Based on your symptoms (severe chest pain and breathing difficulty), this may require immediate medical attention. 

**Please contact emergency services (911) or go to the nearest emergency room immediately.**

Do not delay seeking emergency medical care. These symptoms can indicate a serious medical condition that needs prompt evaluation.

I'm logging this as a critical symptom entry for your medical records."
