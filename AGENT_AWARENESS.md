# Agent Awareness Plan: Enabling Intelligent Conversational Health Tracking

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation of agent awareness across the TxAgent Medical RAG System, focusing on natural conversational loops for accurate health data collection.

## Overview

The TxAgent system now provides intelligent conversational health tracking through natural dialogue loops that prioritize accurate data collection over verbose medical information. The AI agent, "Symptom Savior," acts as a professional triage nurse/doctor focused on gathering complete, accurate health records.

## Core Philosophy: Data Collection First

**Primary Goal**: Accurate health data logging through natural conversation
**Secondary Goal**: Helpful medical information when appropriate
**Tertiary Goal**: Professional bedside manner without overwhelming users

### Key Principles

1. **Conversational Loops**: One question at a time, building complete entries incrementally
2. **Data Completeness**: Ensure all required fields are collected before saving
3. **Natural Flow**: Human-like conversation without medical "preaching"
4. **Voice-Ready**: Concise responses suitable for voice interfaces
5. **Professional Tone**: Caring healthcare professional demeanor

## Current Architecture

The system operates with enhanced conversational intelligence:

- **🧠 TxAgent Container**: GPU-accelerated processing with conversational tracking loops
- **🔗 Backend Server**: Routes requests and manages authentication
- **📱 Expo User App**: Mobile interface with conversational chat
- **🗄️ Database**: Comprehensive health tracking tables with RLS
- **🎯 Tracking Loops**: Symptom, treatment, and appointment conversational flows

## Phase 3: Conversational Health Tracking - ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Phase 3 Goals - ✅ ACHIEVED
- **Natural Conversation Loops**: Incremental data collection through dialogue
- **Multi-Domain Tracking**: Symptoms, treatments, and appointments
- **Session Management**: Persistent tracking sessions across conversation turns
- **Data Validation**: Complete entries before database storage
- **Voice-Optimized**: Concise, natural responses suitable for voice interfaces

### Phase 3.1: Conversational Tracking Architecture - ✅ IMPLEMENTED

#### A. Tracking Loop Components

**Core Tracking Modules:**
```python
# Symptom Tracker
symptom_tracker.start_symptom_tracking(user_id, query)
symptom_tracker.update_symptom_data(session_id, response)
symptom_tracker.save_to_database(session_id, jwt_token)

# Treatment Tracker  
treatment_tracker.start_treatment_tracking(user_id, query)
treatment_tracker.update_treatment_data(session_id, response)
treatment_tracker.save_to_database(session_id, jwt_token)

# Appointment Tracker
appointment_tracker.start_appointment_tracking(user_id, query)
appointment_tracker.update_appointment_data(session_id, response)
appointment_tracker.save_to_database(session_id, jwt_token)
```

**Session Management:**
- In-memory storage for incomplete entries
- Incremental data collection with progress tracking
- Confirmation loops before database storage
- Session cleanup after successful saves

#### B. Enhanced Conversation Manager

**LLM Suppression for Conversational Strategies:**
- Conversational tracking loops bypass LLM entirely
- Only health information requests use LLM with conversation manager introduction
- Eliminates verbose medical information dumps
- Ensures consistent, focused data collection

**Strategy-Based Response Generation:**
```python
# Conversational strategies handled by conversation manager
conversational_strategies = [
    "symptom_tracking_loop",
    "treatment_tracking_loop", 
    "appointment_tracking_loop",
    "greeting",
    "emergency_response",
    "general_conversation",
    "history_request"
]

# Only health_information strategy uses LLM
llm_strategies = ["health_information"]
```

### Phase 3.2: Database Integration - ✅ IMPLEMENTED

#### A. Health Tracking Tables

**Symptoms Table (`user_symptoms`):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_symptoms (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  symptom_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  severity INTEGER CHECK (severity >= 1 AND severity <= 10),
  description TEXT,
  triggers TEXT[],
  duration_hours INTEGER,
  location TEXT,
  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
```

**Treatments Table (`treatments`):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE treatments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  treatment_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  dosage TEXT,
  duration TEXT,
  description TEXT,
  doctor_recommended BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
```

**Appointments Table (`doctor_visits`):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE doctor_visits (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  visit_ts TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  doctor_name TEXT,
  location TEXT,
  contact_phone TEXT,
  contact_email TEXT,
  visit_prep TEXT,
  visit_summary TEXT,
  follow_up_required BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
```

#### B. Row Level Security (RLS)

All tables implement automatic user data isolation:
- JWT-based authentication with user context
- Automatic filtering by `auth.uid() = user_id`
- Complete data privacy and security

### Phase 3.3: Conversational Flow Examples - ✅ WORKING

#### Symptom Tracking Loop

```
User: "I have a sore throat"
Symptom Savior: "I understand you're experiencing a sore throat. On a scale of 1-10, how severe is your sore throat?"

User: "About a 6"
Symptom Savior: "Got it. How long have you been experiencing this sore throat?"

User: "Since this morning"
Symptom Savior: "✅ I've successfully logged your sore throat.

**Symptom**: Sore Throat
**Severity**: 6/10
**Duration**: 8 hours

Does this look correct? You can say 'yes' to save it or tell me what to change."

User: "Yes"
Symptom Savior: "Symptom successfully saved to your health log!"
```

#### Treatment Tracking Loop

```
User: "I'm taking ibuprofen"
Symptom Savior: "I understand you want to track ibuprofen. What is the dosage or frequency for ibuprofen?"

User: "200mg twice a day"
Symptom Savior: "Got it. How long will you be taking ibuprofen?"

User: "For about a week"
Symptom Savior: "✅ I've successfully logged your ibuprofen.

**Treatment**: Ibuprofen
**Type**: Medication
**Dosage**: 200mg twice a day
**Duration**: For about a week

Does this look correct? You can say 'yes' to save it or tell me what to change."
```

#### Appointment Tracking Loop

```
User: "I have a doctor appointment tomorrow"
Symptom Savior: "I understand you have an appointment tomorrow. What is the name of the doctor or healthcare provider?"

User: "Dr. Smith"
Symptom Savior: "Got it. When is your appointment? (Please include date and time)"

User: "Tomorrow at 2 PM"
Symptom Savior: "✅ I've successfully logged your appointment with Dr. Smith.

**Doctor**: Dr. Smith
**Date & Time**: Tuesday, January 16, 2024 at 2:00 PM

Does this look correct? You can say 'yes' to save it or tell me what to change."
```

### Phase 3.4: Enhanced User Experience - ✅ ACHIEVED

```
User: "Hi"
Symptom Savior: "Hello Sarah! I'm here to help you track symptoms, medications, and appointments. How can I help you today?"
```

#### Natural Health Questions

```
User: "What's the difference between a cold and flu?"
Symptom Savior: "That's a great question about cold and flu. Let me provide some helpful information.

[Concise, helpful explanation]

💡 This information is for educational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

❓ Are you experiencing any symptoms yourself, or is this just general information you're looking for?"
```

#### Emergency Detection

```
User: "I'm having severe chest pain"
Symptom Savior: "🚨 URGENT: Based on your symptoms, this may require immediate medical attention. Please contact emergency services (911) or go to the nearest emergency room immediately.

💡 Do not delay seeking emergency medical care. These symptoms can indicate a serious medical condition that needs prompt evaluation."
