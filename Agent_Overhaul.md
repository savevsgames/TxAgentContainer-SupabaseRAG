# Agent Overhaul Plan: Real-Time Conversational Health Tracking

## Executive Summary

The current TxAgent implementation has fundamental flaws in intent detection and conversation flow that prevent it from achieving its core mission: **accurate health data logging through natural conversation**. This overhaul plan redesigns the system from the ground up to create a focused, real-time conversation agent that excels at one thing: helping users log symptoms, treatments, and appointments through natural dialogue.

## Current Problems Identified

### 1. **Intent Detection Failures**
- System fails to recognize basic symptoms like "sore throat" and "sore knee"
- Overly complex NLP processing that misses simple, direct statements
- False positives creating hallucinated data (e.g., "Dr. Albuterol")
- Multiple competing intent systems causing confusion

### 2. **Conversation Flow Issues**
- Agent repeats greetings despite conversation history
- Verbose responses unsuitable for real-time voice interaction
- No clear conversation state management
- Attempts to do too much instead of focusing on data collection

### 3. **Scope Creep**
- System tries to be a medical advisor instead of a data collector
- Complex medical advice generation when users just want to log symptoms
- Multiple phases of development creating conflicting logic paths

## Core Mission Redefinition

**PRIMARY GOAL**: Create a focused conversational agent that excels at collecting accurate health data through natural dialogue.

**SECONDARY GOALS**: 
- Prepare foundation for real-time voice interaction
- Maintain professional healthcare demeanor
- Ensure data accuracy and completeness

**OUT OF SCOPE**:
- Complex medical advice generation
- Verbose educational responses
- Multiple conversation strategies

## New Architecture: Simplified & Focused

    COLLECTING_APPOINTMENT = "collecting_appointment"
    CONFIRMING_DATA = "confirming_data"
    SAVING_DATA = "saving_data"
    COMPLETED = "completed"
```

### Phase 2: Real-Time Voice Integration

Once the text-based foundation is solid, the same conversation logic will power:
- Real-time voice processing with 11Labs
- Avatar-based interactions
- Seamless voice/text switching

## Implementation Strategy

### Step 1: Simplified Intent Detection

**Replace complex NLP with reliable pattern matching:**

```python
class SimpleIntentDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        # Comprehensive symptom keywords
        self.symptom_keywords = [
            "headache", "pain", "ache", "hurt", "sore", "fever", "nausea",
            "toothache", "earache", "stomach ache", "back pain", "chest pain",
            "sore throat", "runny nose", "cough", "dizziness", "fatigue",
            # ... comprehensive list
        ]
        
        # Treatment keywords
        self.treatment_keywords = [
            "taking", "medication", "medicine", "pill", "treatment",
            "prescribed", "ibuprofen", "tylenol", "advil",
            # ... comprehensive list
        ]
        
        # Appointment keywords
        self.appointment_keywords = [
            "appointment", "doctor", "visit", "checkup", "dr.",
            "scheduled", "see", "meeting"
        ]
    
    def detect_intent(self, query: str) -> str:
        query_lower = query.lower()
        
        # Direct keyword matching - no complex NLP
        if any(keyword in query_lower for keyword in self.symptom_keywords):
            return "symptom"
        elif any(keyword in query_lower for keyword in self.treatment_keywords):
            return "treatment"
        elif any(keyword in query_lower for keyword in self.appointment_keywords):
            return "appointment"
        elif self._is_greeting(query_lower):
            return "greeting"
        else:
            return "general"
```

### Step 2: Focused Data Collectors

**Each collector has ONE job: gather complete, accurate data**

```python
class SymptomCollector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.required_fields = ["name", "severity"]
        self.optional_fields = ["duration", "location"]
        self.current_field = None
        
    def start_collection(self, initial_query: str) -> dict:
        # Extract what we can from initial query
        data = self._extract_initial_data(initial_query)
        
        # Determine next question
        next_field = self._get_next_required_field(data)
        
        return {
            "message": f"I understand you have {data.get('name', 'a symptom')}.",
            "question": self._get_question_for_field(next_field, data),
            "data": data,
            "progress": self._calculate_progress(data)
        }
    
    def process_response(self, response: str, current_data: dict) -> dict:
        # Update data with response
        updated_data = self._update_data(response, current_data)
        
        # Check if complete
        if self._is_complete(updated_data):
            return self._generate_confirmation(updated_data)
        else:
            next_field = self._get_next_required_field(updated_data)
            return {
                "message": "Got it.",
                "question": self._get_question_for_field(next_field, updated_data),
                "data": updated_data,
                "progress": self._calculate_progress(updated_data)
            }
```

### Step 3: Conversation Engine

**Single source of truth for conversation flow:**

```python
class ConversationEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.intent_detector = SimpleIntentDetector()
        self.collectors = {
            "symptom": SymptomCollector(),
            "treatment": TreatmentCollector(),
            "appointment": AppointmentCollector()
        }
        self.sessions = {}  # In-memory session storage
        
    def process_message(self, user_id: str, message: str) -> dict:
        session = self._get_or_create_session(user_id)
        
        # Handle based on current state
        if session.state == ConversationState.IDLE:
            return self._handle_new_conversation(session, message)
        elif session.state in [ConversationState.COLLECTING_SYMPTOM, 
                              ConversationState.COLLECTING_TREATMENT,
                              ConversationState.COLLECTING_APPOINTMENT]:
            return self._handle_data_collection(session, message)
        elif session.state == ConversationState.CONFIRMING_DATA:
            return self._handle_confirmation(session, message)
        else:
            return self._handle_general_response(session, message)
    
    def _handle_new_conversation(self, session, message):
        intent = self.intent_detector.detect_intent(message)
        
        if intent == "greeting":
            session.state = ConversationState.GREETING
            return {"message": f"Hello! I'm here to help you track symptoms, medications, and appointments. How can I help you today?"}
        
        elif intent in ["symptom", "treatment", "appointment"]:
            session.state = f"collecting_{intent}"
            session.current_collector = intent
            return self.collectors[intent].start_collection(message)
        
        else:
            return {"message": "I can help you track symptoms, medications, or appointments. What would you like to log?"}
```

### Step 4: Response Generator

**Concise, voice-ready responses:**

```python
class ResponseGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.max_response_length = 50  # Words, not characters
        
    def generate_question(self, field: str, context: dict) -> str:
        templates = {
            "severity": "On a scale of 1-10, how severe is your {symptom}?",
            "duration": "How long have you had this {symptom}?",
            "dosage": "What's the dosage for {treatment}?",
            "doctor_name": "What's the doctor's name?",
            "appointment_time": "When is your appointment?"
        }
        
        template = templates.get(field, "Can you tell me more about that?")
        return template.format(**context)
    
    def generate_confirmation(self, data: dict, data_type: str) -> str:
        if data_type == "symptom":
            return f"I've logged your {data['name']} with severity {data['severity']}/10. Does this look correct?"
        elif data_type == "treatment":
            return f"I've logged {data['name']} at {data['dosage']}. Does this look correct?"
        elif data_type == "appointment":
            return f"I've logged your appointment with {data['doctor_name']} on {data['date']}. Does this look correct?"
```

## Database Integration Strategy

### Simplified Database Operations

```python
class DatabaseManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = auth_service.get_authenticated_client()
    
    async def save_symptom(self, user_id: str, data: dict) -> dict:
        try:
            result = self.client.table("user_symptoms").insert({
                "user_id": user_id,
                "symptom_name": data["name"],
                "severity": data["severity"],
                "duration_hours": data.get("duration_hours"),
                "location": data.get("location"),
                "description": f"{data['name']} - severity {data['severity']}/10"
            }).execute()
            
            return {"success": True, "id": result.data[0]["id"]}
        except Exception as e:
            return {"success": False, "error": str(e)}
    
    async def save_treatment(self, user_id: str, data: dict) -> dict:
        # Similar pattern for treatments
        pass
    
    async def save_appointment(self, user_id: str, data: dict) -> dict:
        # Similar pattern for appointments
        pass
```

## API Endpoint Redesign

### Single Chat Endpoint

```python
@app.post("/chat")
async def chat(request: ChatRequest, authorization: str = Header(None)):
    """
    Single endpoint for all conversational health tracking.
    Maintains existing API contract while using new conversation engine.
    """
    try:
        # Validate JWT
        token = auth_service.extract_token_from_header(authorization)
        user_id, user_payload = auth_service.validate_token_and_get_user(token)
        
        # Process with conversation engine
        result = conversation_engine.process_message(user_id, request.query)
        
        # Format response to match existing API contract
        return ChatResponse(
            response=result["message"],
            sources=[],  # No sources for conversational tracking
            processing_time=50,  # Fast response time
            model="Symptom Savior",
            tokens_used=0,
            status="success",
            tracking_session_id=result.get("session_id")
        )
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Chat error: {str(e)}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

## Testing Strategy

### Comprehensive Test Cases

```python
class TestConversationEngine:
    def test_symptom_tracking_flow(self):
        engine = ConversationEngine()
        user_id = "test_user"
        
        # Test 1: Initial symptom mention
        response1 = engine.process_message(user_id, "I have a sore throat")
        assert "severity" in response1["message"].lower()
        
        # Test 2: Severity response
        response2 = engine.process_message(user_id, "about a 6")
        assert "duration" in response2["message"].lower() or "correct" in response2["message"].lower()
        
        # Test 3: Confirmation
        response3 = engine.process_message(user_id, "yes")
        assert "saved" in response3["message"].lower()
    
    def test_treatment_tracking_flow(self):
        # Similar test for treatment tracking
        pass
    
    def test_appointment_tracking_flow(self):
        # Similar test for appointment tracking
        pass
```

## Conclusion

This overhaul plan transforms TxAgent from a complex, unfocused system into a laser-focused conversational health data collector. By simplifying the architecture, improving intent detection, and optimizing for real-time interaction, we create a foundation that excels at its core mission while preparing for future voice and avatar integration.

The key insight is that **less is more**: by doing one thing exceptionally well (health data collection through conversation), we create a more valuable and reliable system than trying to be a comprehensive medical advisor.

**Next Steps**: Begin implementation with SimpleIntentDetector and ConversationEngine, focusing on getting the "sore throat" and "sore knee" use cases working perfectly before expanding functionality.
